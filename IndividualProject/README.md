# Individual Project: Pulse Rate and SPO2 measurement on ESP8266

_Github Repository for ECNG 3006 Individual Project_


## How to use example

### Functional Requirements

* [Q1] The system has to measure a person's heart/pulse rate (in beats per minute).
* [Q2] The system has to estimate a person's oxygen saturation level (as a %). 
* [Q3] The system should operate using a 9V battery for a duration, and in a manner consistent with, the desired use-case scenario.
* [Q4] The system should be capable of reporting (live or stored) measurements via wired/wireless serial connection upon receipt of pre-determined ASCII sequence of 1 to 4 characters.
* [Q5] All sensors/system measurements should be calibrated and/or the error quantified.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run PuTTY to view the serial outputs fromt the projects.


## Example Outputs

* See README.md of subfolders for more details.
